* Trumpest

The goal of this project is to create a web-tech-based distributed "database" of Trump related data.
The core of the idea is to use [[https://www.w3.org/2013/csvw/wiki/Main_Page][CSVW]] to create web structures which allows separately developed databases to be interlinked.

For example, if two repos of data have CSVs with columns containing individuals names, then CSVW can be used to map between those two repos so that "joins" can be performed to find individuals on which there is data within both repos. 

The term "database" as used herein explicitly does not mean RDBMS/SQL tech. This is only about how data is
expressed on the web, which may very well have a RDBMS behind it - or be based in a Google Doc spreadsheet - but such details are irrelevant.
