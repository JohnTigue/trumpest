As reported in [[https://www.publicintegrity.org/2017/04/04/20801/new-database-details-white-house-officials-finances][New database details White House officials' finances]]:
>The Center for Public Integrity’s news developer, [[https://www.publicintegrity.org/authors/chris-zubak-skees][Chris Zubak-Skees]], extracted these details from more than 90 reports, released in PDF format, using a software tool he created.

That tool is called [[https://github.com/PublicI/pfd-parser][pdf-parser]]:
>Very WIP parser for Office of Government ethics form 278 public financial disclosure PDFs

The code is written in NodeJS, using modern style JavaScript (read: Promises, etc).

The license is [[https://github.com/PublicI/pfd-parser/blob/master/LICENSE][MIT]].

The result of running the financial disclosure PDFs through `pdf-parser` are available in a downloadable spreadsheet.
[[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V1axPEZNHVwgpJTkWMCRJaiAU67poc4ycOaMP3xtKuE/edit][That spreadsheet]] is on Google Docs.

The columns are:

*** Data
[TBD]

**** CSVW Data
The core here is a key to an individual (i.e. their name, well formatted) and a link to the disclosure document.
Other attributes could be added but the above is the core so let's start there.
So, there should be a CSV (and CSVW metadata) listing of known disclosures.
