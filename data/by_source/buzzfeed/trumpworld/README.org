It seems to be exported from some network mapping application.
The export consists of 3 tables:

- organization to person relationships
- person to person relationships

The data is available in a [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z5Vo5pbvxKJ5XpfALZXvCzW26Cl4we3OaN73K9Ae5Ss/edit#gid=2097215557][Google Docs spreadsheet]]. The data is also in GitHub.
