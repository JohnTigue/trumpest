* Trumpest best practices
** Introduction
This document discusses best practices for encoding Trumpest related data.
The goal is to inform data publisher ways in which they can enable reuse of the data they publish.

For example, for one data source to contain the string "John Tigue" and another to contain "Tigue, John" is not optimal.
Another example would be dates: one source have, e.g., "Feb-14" and another "2/14" is suboptimal.

(Of course, part of the magic of CSVW is the capacity to map between such inconsistencies but why make this harder than it has to be?)

** Standards
- Date and Time Formats
  - ISO 8601 
  - [[https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime][W3C Note: NOTE-datetime]]

** Data types
*** Dates
*** Names
*** Locations
- capitalization
  - Pretty easy to align these in code but still "BETHESDA, Maryland" would be better as "Bethesda, Maryland"
